# Learn Python The Hard Way

My Python exercises August - October 2015, based on the excellent book [Learn
Python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

The book uses Python 2, I've done most exercises in Python 3 though.
(Seems like "the hard way" isn't hard enough for some.)

Enjoy.
